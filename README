PivotalTracker to Github Issues migration scripts

1. Clone this repo
2. Run in console: gem install httparty
3. Import all user stories from PivotalTracker to csv file
4. Name it issues.csv
5. Check and change repository paths inside these scripts
6. If you need to clear all existing repo labels, run: ruby delete_labels.rb
7. For importing tickets from csv to repo, run: ruby import_issues.rb issues.csv

Thanks for making these scripts to @robotarmy and his gist: https://gist.github.com/2257596
